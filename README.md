# Facebookish clone

I created this application as an exercise after read the [react documentation](https://reactjs.org/)   (my first react project)

## Informations

This application comes with a [Rails application (API)](https://github.com/GuillaumeOcculy/blog_api).

You MUST clone it and follow the instructions first.

There is no security because I'm too lazy to do it for a draft project.


### `npm start`
- Run `npm install` first
- `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
